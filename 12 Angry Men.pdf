1. Dont judge by the age!

               For a while I was not very receptive to watching films that) Tj
T* (were too old. I always thought it would be difficult to get involved in the context, I couldn't be more) Tj
T* (wrong! 12 angry men, is a great example of how a simple film can do magic with good actors, and what great) Tj
T* (actors they are!) Tj
T* (
2. Excellent

               An excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. Instead of following the) Tj
T* (trial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room.) Tj
T* (The film begins with the end of the trial. The jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is) Tj
T* (taken and the result is 11:1 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have raised their hands to) Tj
T* (convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror #8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly) Tj
T* (believe the young man to be innocent but notes \(rightfully\) that the case for the defence might have been) Tj
T* (presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. Since the) Tj
T* (boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that) Tj
T* (the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the jurors change their) Tj
T* (minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. But) Tj
T* (not everyone is easy to convince.

Although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see) Tj
T* (what little things can influence which way a verdict goes, where this film really succeeds is in) Tj
T* (presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. The character of each of the jurors emerges through a) Tj
T* (wonderful mix of perfect casting, excellent dialogue and near-flawless acting.

Juror #1 - a simple man) Tj
T* (who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do) Tj
T* (everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film - when he) Tj
T* (talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does) Tj
T* (not relish.

Juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to) Tj
T* (expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an) Tj
T* (accountant.

Juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant) Tj
T* (self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is) Tj
T* (reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow) Tj
T* (personally involved with the case. He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability.) Tj
T* (Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over.

Juror #4 -) Tj
T* (self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else) Tj
T* (in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but \(as one of the jurors says - "this is) Tj
T* (not an exact science"\) he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the) Tj
T* (people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take) Tj
T* (his jacket off \(it is a very hot day\).

Juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes) Tj
T* (from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify) Tj
T* (with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want) Tj
T* (compassion to influence him - so ironically it does.

Juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting) Tj
T* (that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he) Tj
T* (really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.

Juror #7 - the only one) Tj
T* (that really has no opinion on this case. Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case) Tj
T* (- he talks of baseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or) Tj
T* (that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man) Tj
T* (he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's) Tj
T* (worth the bother.

Juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the other) Tj
T* (jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.

Juror #9 - a wise old man) Tj
T* (with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.

Juror #10 - the most) Tj
T* (horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only) Tj
T* (because of the boy's social background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is) Tj
T* (only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.

Juror #11 -) Tj
T* (an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of) Tj
T* (people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his) Tj
T* (temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7.

Juror #12 - a young business type) Tj
T* (- perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to) Tj
T* (be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.

The film succeeds in) Tj
T* (doing something very rare today - developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable,) Tj
T* (memorable and distinct characters.) Tj
