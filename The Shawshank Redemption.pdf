1. Tied for the best movie I have ever seen

               Why do I want to write the 234th comment on) Tj
T* (The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been) Tj
T* (said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and) Tj
T* (eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.

The only other movie I have ever seen that) Tj
T* (effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched) Tj
T* (them.

I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch) Tj
T* (them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our) Tj
T* (older patrons, she said to me, "Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and) Tj
T* (it always makes me feel better." At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing) Tj
T* (on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many) Tj
T* (times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then) Tj
T* (and it gets better with every showing.

No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms) Tj
T* (talking to each other.

The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever) Tj
T* (seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that) Tj
T* (Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best) Tj
T* (technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones) Tj
T* (that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.) Tj
T* (
2. Some birds aren't meant to be caged.

               The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed) Tj
T* (by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.) Tj
T* (Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne \(Robbins\), a banker) Tj
T* (who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her) Tj
T* (lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis) Tj
T* ("Red" Redding \(Freeman\). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more) Tj
T* (befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things) Tj
T* (for all of them.

There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a) Tj
T* (title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure) Tj
T* (how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award) Tj
T* (time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film) Tj
T* (for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an) Tj
T* (audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic.) Tj
T* (Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for) Tj
T* (sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new) Tj
T* (fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.

It's possibly the simplicity of it all) Tj
T* (that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental) Tj
T* (edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film) Tj
T* (with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as) Tj
T* (churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is) Tj
T* (indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul) Tj
T* (involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never) Tj
T* (more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins \(never) Tj
T* (better\) & Freeman \(sublimely making it easy\), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and) Tj
T* (Red.

Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton,) Tj
T* (James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the "Birdman Of Shawshank," Clancy Brown is menacing as) Tj
T* (antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as) Tj
T* (Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out) Tj
T* (of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters \(yes, they are ours\). The music pings in) Tj
T* (conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based,) Tj
T* (dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the) Tj
T* (likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.

If you love Shawshank then it's a) Tj
T* (love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement -) Tj
T* (happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed) Tj
T* (wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a) Tj
T* (better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10) Tj
