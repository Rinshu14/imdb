1. An absolutely incredible film!

               Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour) Tj
T* (movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how) Tj
T* (similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.

Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed) Tj
T* (fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad) Tj
T* (Tom Bombadil was scrubbed \(I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book\). Despite these) Tj
T* (minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well \(and the prologue) Tj
T* (was a nice touch\).

The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen) Tj
T* (doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to) Tj
T* (Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but) Tj
T* (wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a) Tj
T* (PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.

The special effects were incredible, the cave) Tj
T* (troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless) Tj
T* (shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.

What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I) Tj
T* (thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!) Tj
T* (
2. Wow!

               Breathtaking. Unique. Captivating. Enchanting.

Within minutes of the start of) Tj
T* (this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the) Tj
T* (images on the screen. And we had nearly three hours to go.

The scope of Tolkien's masterpiece may have) Tj
T* (eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only) Tj
T* (brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth. And believe me, it) Tj
T* (is BIG. Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities) Tj
T* (and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.

But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and) Tj
T* (sound-effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters. Ian) Tj
T* (McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the) Tj
T* (most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time. The despair, terror, and) Tj
T* (determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades. I left the theater aching...from tensing every) Tj
T* (muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since) Tj
T* (Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.

Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's) Tj
T* (world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so. The depth of his creation cannot be grasped) Tj
T* (in a few hours, and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and) Tj
T* (leaves little room for complaint.

The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their) Tj
T* (seats, feeling somewhat bereft. We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.

Jackson's) Tj
T* (ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year. George Lucas and Chris Columbus) Tj
T* (take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.

For everyone else: don't you dare miss it.) Tj
