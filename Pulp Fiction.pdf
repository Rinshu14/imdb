1. A masterpiece of screenwriting

               This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way) Tj
T* (to say it. It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is) Tj
T* (so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. The movie doesn't seem to be about any) Tj
T* (spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. The characters and) Tj
T* (preformances in this movie are practically perfect. This is still one of the best performances I've seen) Tj
T* (from Sam Jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an Oscar. Each scene has its own unique flavour and) Tj
T* (charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. The comedy is great, the serious) Tj
T* (moments are great, every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist.) Tj
T* (This movie is just such a great time, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies. I cannot think of a) Tj
T* (single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time.) Tj
T* (
2. The masterpiece without a message

               One of the early scenes in "Pulp Fiction" features) Tj
T* (two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and) Tj
T* (entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't) Tj
T* (know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than) Tj
T* (the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their) Tj
T* (victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet) Tj
T* (without such scenes, "Pulp Fiction" wouldn't be "Pulp Fiction." I get the sense that Tarantino put into) Tj
T* (the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully) Tj
T* (textured.

It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more) Tj
T* (into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many) Tj
T* (astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for) Tj
T* (some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. "Pulp Fiction," is, as the title indicates,) Tj
T* (purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous) Tj
T* (references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or "art about art." It has all the) Tj
T* (characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters,) Tj
T* (and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The) Tj
T* (self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.

The movie becomes a bit easier) Tj
T* (to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of) Tj
T* (the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard) Tj
T* (gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole) Tj
T* (situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures.) Tj
T* (Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead,) Tj
T* (even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.

Perhaps no screenplay has ever) Tj
T* (found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character) Tj
T* (ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, "Be cool and) Tj
T* (no one's going to get hurt," which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill) Tj
T* (action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of) Tj
T* (his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop) Tj
T* (culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human) Tj
T* (behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, "That's when you know you've found somebody special: when) Tj
T* (you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence."

What is the movie's) Tj
T* (purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of) Tj
T* (character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the) Tj
T* (big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has) Tj
T* (over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not) Tj
T* (ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away.) Tj
T* (The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of) Tj
T* (the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance,) Tj
T* (at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful) Tj
T* (characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are) Tj
T* (not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that) Tj
T* (surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because) Tj
T* (it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.

There's a nice moral) Tj
T* (progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than) Tj
T* (loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends,) Tj
T* (however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent) Tj
T* (outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.

Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying) Tj
T* (together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really "about" anything. They certainly) Tj
T* (are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it) Tj
T* (contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever) Tj
T* (reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.) Tj
