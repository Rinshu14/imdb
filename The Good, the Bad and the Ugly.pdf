1. Brutal, brilliant, and one of the best Westerns ever made

               A sprawling Western epic) Tj
T* (that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen gold, Sergio Leone's `The) Tj
T* (Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is a masterpiece, one that continues to get better and better with each) Tj
T* (viewing. In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in a) Tj
T* (realistic manner. Sometimes, crime does pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go) Tj
T* (unrewarded. This film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional John Wayne `White Hat/Black) Tj
T* (Hat' Western.

The three main characters make the film. Lee Van Cleef \(`The Bad'\) is evil personified.) Tj
T* (Totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Clint Eastwood \(`The Good'\) is the Man) Tj
T* (With No Name, not really `good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries) Tj
T* (to do the right thing. \(Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar -) Tj
T* (powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.\)) Tj
T* (Eli Wallach \(`The Ugly'\) is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the) Tj
T* (film. All impulse and rage, Tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be) Tj
T* (Clint Eastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco truly represents `the) Tj
T* (ugly' side of people.

The movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film. Each one slowly lets) Tj
T* (the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on.) Tj
T* (The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable) Tj
T* (tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable. Any typical Western cliché that you) Tj
T* (can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful) Tj
T* (storytelling. Of special mention is Ennio Morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect. Two scenes - one) Tj
T* (in a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing) Tj
T* (on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with Morricone's powerful score.

This) Tj
T* (movie is absolutely brilliant. If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge to do so. Immediately. \(And) Tj
T* (then, go watch `Unforgiven' . . . in a way, I think that `Unforgiven' is the sequel to `The Good, the Bad,) Tj
T* (and the Ugly - it's the story of what eventually happened to the Man With No Name.\) `The Good, the Bad,) Tj
T* (and the Ugly' is easily one of the best Westerns ever made. A++) Tj
T* (
2. Primal honesty and morality

               After many years of barely watching any movies, I treated) Tj
T* (myself to several classics recently. And this was the best.

That I so enjoyed this movie so much came as) Tj
T* (a shock to me. I literally never before have been able to even sit through a western, which \(in my) Tj
T* (admittedly limited experience\) was schlock action starring John Wayne as the taciturn all-American good) Tj
T* (guy being tough and beating up the outlaws. Watching GBU, I was enthralled for the entire three hours.) Tj
T* (Twice. And if I had time, I would have watched it a third time.

The setting is typically western: a dry,) Tj
T* (dusty panorama in which men barely co-exist with each other; few wasted words; and lots of action, horses,) Tj
T* (and gunfighting in a wild west barely governed by incipient institutions of law & order – all shrouded) Tj
T* (within a morality play of good vs. bad. But what I liked so much is exactly what I hate about John Wayne) Tj
T* (westerns – the seriousness and honesty with which moral context is considered. In Hollywood, good vs. bad) Tj
T* (is as thoughtlessly superscripted as the protagonists' white and black hats. In GBU every remnant of) Tj
T* (moralizing has been ruthlessly cut.

Good, Bad, and Ugly are personified in the form of three characters:) Tj
T* (Bad \("Sentenza"\) is the easiest to understand. He is *very* bad, perhaps not so different from other) Tj
T* (villains, but much more sharply developed; murderous, sadistic, traitorous, and remorseless. Good) Tj
T* (\("Blondie"\) and Ugly \("Tuco"\) are more puzzling, but their labels are the key to the movie. Both Blondie) Tj
T* (and Tuco are outlaws and killers with only the barest hint of morality, but they're not evil in the same) Tj
T* (way that Sentenza is. Tuco is demonstrative, emotional, loud, wild, and unpredictable; but driven by) Tj
T* (survival rather than satanic urges. Blondie is cool, calm, rational and controlled – in many ways similar) Tj
T* (to Sentenza – but whereas Sentenza tortures, maims, kills, and lies for the hell of it, even apparently) Tj
T* (enjoys it, Blondie simply goes about his business coolly, and shows several poignant hints of empathy,) Tj
T* (decency, and a sense of justice.

GBU takes place during the Civil War and strips away the high-level) Tj
T* (political struggle of history books, leaving us with the soldier's vantage point of brutality, pointless) Tj
T* (death, and some individual decency. The politics are indecipherable from this vantage point. GBU hits this) Tj
T* (point home when our protagonists wind up in a prison camp because the oncoming gray cavalry uniforms turn) Tj
T* (out to be dust-covered blue. Later, they encounter an army fighting over a worthless bridge, suffering) Tj
T* (countless pointless deaths and casualties. Because Leone has so rigorously excised traditional) Tj
T* (off-the-shelf morality, the few instances of humanity are remarkably poignant. One such instance is when) Tj
T* (Blondie shares his coat and cigar with a dying soldier; another is when prisoners are forced – by) Tj
T* (Sentenza's orders – to play music to cover up the screams of the tortured. Sentenza apparently enjoyed the) Tj
T* (irony of beautiful sounds used for such ends; the musicians are, of course, pained by it.

That was one of) Tj
T* (many extraordinarily striking scenes. The honesty of the moral context was what I liked best about the) Tj
T* (film, but I liked everything else too. Indeed the same primal, ruthless honesty that characterizes the) Tj
T* (character development pervades the film. The music is unlike anything I'd ever heard – it's an audible) Tj
T* (version of the arid west and the tensions and lawlessness that characterize the film. Underlying the) Tj
T* (entire score is one instantly memorable theme starting off with what sounds like a screaming hyena. The) Tj
T* (story took place in New Mexico, and even though it was filmed in Spain, it really does look like New) Tj
T* (Mexico; and just as in life in the American west, the wide, breathtaking panorama tends to subordinates) Tj
T* (dialog. Indeed, it is several minutes into the film before even one word is spoken.

The plot was) Tj
T* (extremely clever – and never predictable. High level suspense is maintained for the full three hours. It) Tj
T* (was hard to imagine how it could unfold – three uncompromising outlaws in search of one buried treasure;) Tj
T* (cooperation was not in their nature, but nothing was ever done out of character. Any Western cliché that) Tj
T* (you can think of is either given a unique twist or destroyed by masterful storytelling. For example there) Tj
T* (is an utterly irreverent scene in which Tuco meets his brother, a sincere Priest, and turns platitudes) Tj
T* (upside down. The brother begins with the standard rebuke of the criminal's behavior, but Tuco punches back) Tj
T* (and says, "Where we come from there were only two ways out. You lacked the courage to do what I've done.") Tj
T* (The movie is also irreverently funny: For example, Twice Tuco gained the upper hand on Blondie and) Tj
T* (said:

"There are two kinds of spurs\(?\), my friend. Those that come in by the door, and \(crosses himself\)) Tj
T* (those that come in by the window."

"There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who have) Tj
T* (a rope around their neck and those who have the job of cutting." Later Blondie gained the advantage of) Tj
T* (Tuco and observed:

"You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend - those with loaded guns,) Tj
T* (and those who dig. You dig." In addition to all these specific attributes, a unique and strikingly cool) Tj
T* (style infuses the entire film: long scenes of tense silences – never for an instant boring; and telling,) Tj
T* (startling close-ups and transitions. Most noteworthy was the film's climax. As the protagonists stand) Tj
T* (there with their fingers on their holsters, waiting for the first person to go for their gun\(s\), the) Tj
T* (transitions start out slowly, and speed up as the tension increases. As I write this, I wish I had my own) Tj
T* (copy of the film, just so I could see this scene again.

Not just a great western, but easily one of the) Tj
T* (best movies of *any* kind ever made.) Tj
